# mojo_pinger
Verilog code for the HC-SR04 ping module on a mojo.

I wanted to see how well and how responsive I could make the HC-SR04 work to see if I could use them in a few projects I am working on. This is the result of my investigation. A short video demoing this code can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Caq95prj6HY .
